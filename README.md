# Hydrological Model Calibration   

Python code for automatically calibrating hydrological models using optimization algroithms ([differential evolution](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.differential_evolution.html)).   
Developed for Geography undergraduate dissertation on hydrological modelling of the Senegal River Basin.      

- model_calibration_smallerDT.py: for calibrating most upstream sub-basin models.   
- model_calibration_DS_smallerDT.py: for calibrating sub-basins that have inflow from upstream discharge.
